# Requirement Specification


# 1. Introduction


# 2. Current State
Our company is a small retail store in Eger, Hungary, where we sell high quality headphones and headphone accessories. We've been existing for the past 3 years only as a local store near the city center, where customers can try and purchase from a wide variety of headphone gear. During these years our team have been continuously expanding their knowledge about headphones and audio gear to the point of expertise. In the past few months we started to gain more and more customers and since us being the only headphone retail store in the region most of our customers are travelling here from far away to purchase our products. Because of this, we would like to improve and extend our business and as a part of it, have an online website where we can satisfy our customers who live farther away as well.

# 3. Scope
Our vision is to have an online website, where we can sell our products to our customers without them having to travel to our shop. On this website they can browse all of our products in store and see their technical details. After choosing their desired product, they have the option to purchase it on the website. After that, our team can see the order on the website, and manage it. The shipping process then can be done manually by one of our employees. Besides that, we would like to have a user management system too where our customers can register, fill out their personal information like their name and shipping address, and they can purchase with their account more easily.
