# Requirement Specification


# 1. Introduction


# 2. Current State
    Our company is a small retail store in Eger, Hungary, where we sell high quality headphones and headphone accessories. We've been existing for the past 3 years only as a local store near the city center, where customers can try and purchase from a wide variety of headphone gear. During these years our team have been continuously expanding their knowledge about headphones and audio gear to the point of expertise. In the past few months we started to gain more and more customers and since us being the only headphone retail store in the region most of our customers are travelling here from far away to purchase our products. Because of this, we would like to improve and extend our business and as a part of it, have an online website where we can satisfy our customers who live farther away as well.
