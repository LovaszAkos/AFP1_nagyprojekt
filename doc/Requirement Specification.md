# Requirement Specification


# 1. Introduction


# 2. Current State
Our company is a small retail store in Eger, Hungary, where we sell high quality headphones and headphone accessories. We've been existing for the past 3 years only as a local store near the city center, where customers can try and purchase from a wide variety of headphone gear. During these years our team have been continuously expanding their knowledge about headphones and audio gear to the point of expertise. In the past few months we started to gain more and more customers and since us being the only headphone retail store in the region most of our customers are travelling here from far away to purchase our products. Because of this, we would like to improve and extend our business and as a part of it, have an online website where we can satisfy our customers who live farther away as well.

# 3. Scope
Our vision is to have an online website, where we can sell our products to our customers without them having to travel to our shop. On this website they can browse all of our products in store and see their technical details. After choosing their desired product, they have the option to purchase it on the website. After that, our team can see the order on the website, and manage it. The shipping process then can be done manually by one of our employees. Besides that, we would like to have a user management system too where our customers can register, fill out their personal information like their name and shipping address, and they can purchase with their account more easily.

# 6. Current Business Model
The team is currently listening a lot of music in multiple platforms. Because of it we made the choice that we need to start a webshop in order to satisfy the people's demands. This webshop will show the best headsets and headphones for different music genres.  Right now, we are able to work very well as a team because we have been created a website and managed it correctly.
This time the project aims to extend the functionalities of the client company by providing a fully functional online webshop.

Before the release of the webshop, we will be searching for different headphones and look at their description to classify. For example, there are rare ones which are hard to find in the store.
In the current situation, when the CoVid-19 is spreading and infecting people, we need to stay at home. To prevent people from the virus, we will create a webshop, which will be connected directly to the product storage, where the customers can find headsets and headphones they need, so they don't have to go to the store. That means every order will be shipped right from the webshop, which makes it easier to save people.

Furthermore, ordering an item online is much more convenient than taking any form of public trasportation to get to the store, not even mentioning the pollution that cars or any type of public trasportation vehicle can cause to the atmosphere, and also you don't need to spend hours to get to the store, trying to find the headphone you wanted, especially if tihs day is one of the weekend days, you need to deal with the crowd everywhere in the city, and actually in this time you can't bw with your loved ones or  you can't just relax at home.
Ordering from home is not just convenient but also protects the environment, and protect your nerves from becoming too angry about the lots of people all around the city. That is the main reason the website shall be created and help to make the customers' lives so much easier.
